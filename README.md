Each run contains one AVL tree only. The first line contains a positive integer N, the number of nodes of the initial AVL tree. The second line contains N integers a1,a2,...,an, which is the ordered list of the value of nodes in the AVL tree. Then, it will continue read the input until EOF is read

I: The insertion command. The command is followed by an integer input, the desired number to be inserted into the AVL tree.
D: The deletion command. The command is followed by an integer input the desired number to be deleted from the AVL tree.
P: The print command. The command is followed by an integer input = {1, 2, 3}, referring to preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal respectively.
